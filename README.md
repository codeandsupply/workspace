# Workspace and Event Organizer Issue Tracker

## Hosting at the C&S Event Space

Please follow [these directions](hosting-events/README.md) for set up and tear down of all events.

## Troubleshooting guides

* [WiFi and Internet Outage Troubleshooting Guide](WiFi%20and%20Internet%20Outage%20Troubleshooting%20Guide.md)

## Physical space issue management

We use the [Github Physical Space Management](https://medium.com/@colindean/using-github-to-track-issues-with-physical-space-b2efe37b96ad) system that Colin Dean developed.

Use this to help determine who is responsible for addressing an issue. Fall back to `Action: C&S` if you're not sure.
