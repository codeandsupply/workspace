# Information on Hosting Events C&S

## Comfort
Thermostat is in the hallway and is scheduled to turn on eco mode just about every hour on nights and weekends so it may need to be adjusted multiple times for longer events.

To adjust it:
- Tap it to wake it up (if it's not awake)
- Rotate the outside to the left (to adjust the low temperature) or to the right (to adjust the higher temperature)
- Tap it to select the high/low temp to adjust
- Rotate the outside to change the temperature
- Tap it again to set it. If you adjusted it to where the room temp is outside of that range, the heater or AC will turn on.

## Posting to C&S Meetup

You will need to request access from a C&S admin. Then you will have to go through a walk through of our defaults or read the document we will create here about them.

Admins are on the C&S Slack. Go to https://codeandsupply.slack.com/team/ and choose "Admin accounts" from the drop down.

## Preparing the Space for an Event
1) Unlock both entrance doors to the 3rd floor (rotate the lock so the knob rotates)
2) Unlock the main floor entrances  (In the green carpet workspace room, find the timers on the wall. Rotate them so they will be on for as long as you need. The doors will be unlocked for the duration of that timer.)
3) Turn on any lights. (There are 3 switches in the main event room, as well as switches and lamps near both entrances)
4) Optionally, hang up any signs pointing people to the right direction from the entrances
5) There are chairs and tables in the back of the event room that can be set up for the event.
6) Follow any directions below for setting up the projector

## Cleaning the Space After an Event
1) Follow any directions below for turning off the A/V equipment
2) Clean off any tables and chairs that had food or other messes on them
3) Reset the room to its original configuration of tables and chairs
4) Put any food or drinks in the fridge, throw them away, or take them home
5) If the trash is full or smelly, take it out and toss it in the dumpster outside
6) Make sure the timers are off on the main entrance doors
7) Turn off all the lights except the colored lights by the entrance if you're the last to leave
8) Lock both entrance doors back (turn the lock on the doorknob, NOT any deadbolts)


## Setting Up the Audio/Visual Equipment in the Main Event Room (No Live Streaming)

Directions are relative to being behind the podium.

1) (Optional, if needed) Under the podium is a power strip. Turn that on.
2) Plug the yellow-clipped HDMI cable into the presentor's computer. (Extra adapters are in the red cart off to the side of the speaking space)
3) Press the power button on the Pioneer media receiver. (It's on the left).
4) The mode should be "BD/DVD". If it is not, turn the Input Select knob (the left large knob) until that shows.
5) If you are using sound on the computer, it should be set to go through the HDMI port. Use the Volume knob (the right large knob) to adjust it until it sounds right.
6) On the C&S podium cover, the projector remote is velcroed onto the upper right side. Press the green Power button to turn on the projector. It will take about 30 seconds to turn on. The computer should show up on the wall.
7) Turn on the speaker system. (The power switch is on the speaker to the left of the podium). 
8) Move the microphone and stand to an appropriate place. Generally to the left, right, or just above the laptop's screen should work well for this. 
9) Test the volume by adjusting the volume knob on the sound mixer in the corner. (The correct knob is the bottom one in the gray square labelled "SPKR")
10) If you want the room microphone on, you can turn up the volume knob on the sound mixer. (The bottom knob labelled "ROOM")
11) If one sound thing is causing feedback, turn its volume knob down. If everything is causing feedback, turn the bottom right knob labelled "Main Mix". Ideally you want the individual sources to be about 60-75% up and the main to be about 50% up.

## Setting Up the Live Streaming in the Main Event Room

Presently we are unable to do live streaming until we replace one piece of equipment.

## Turning Off the Audio/Visual Equipment

1) Turn off the projector. (Press the green remote button twice. Leave the remote attached to the velcro strip.)
2) Turn off the speakers. (Press the power switch on the speaker to the left of the podium)
3) Turn off the Pioneer media receiver.
4) Turn off the power strips under the podium.
5) Return the HDMI cables to the podium. (There are binder clips that old them to the top of the podium. Put them back.)
